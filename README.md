# Byt-Wyze Technology

### Deterministic APIs for Hard Problems

Byt-Wyze develops deterministic SAT generators, CNF preprocessing tooling,  
and reproducible research standards for the SAT and formal-methods community.

Our mission is to make SAT experimentation transparent, auditable, and repeatable —  
from instance generation to solver preprocessing and model lifting.

## 📦 Projects

### **STTF — SAT Transformation Trace Format**
A deterministic, reversible format for recording CNF preprocessing steps.

- Minimal opcode set covering all core CNF transformations  
- Full trace from original CNF → simplified CNF  
- Deterministic reverse-map for lifting solver models  
- Reference replay + validation engine  
- Designed for research, benchmarking, solver development, and competitions

### **SAT Maker API**
A deterministic SAT instance generator with tunable CES-weighted hardness.

- Deterministic seeds  
- Controllable structure  
- CES weighting for reproducible difficulty  
- Ideal for benchmarking, ML datasets, and solver evaluation  
- Delivered via API for industrial, academic, and automated workflows

## 🎯 Our Vision
- Establish deterministic standards for SAT research and tooling  
- Enable transparent, reproducible solver pipelines  
- Support dataset generation, ML training, and benchmarking  
- Build a suite of deterministic APIs for hard computational problems  

We believe the SAT community deserves infrastructure built for clarity,  
repeatability, and scientific rigor.

## 🗺 Roadmap (2025)

- Formal STTF v1.1 specification  
- Extended preprocessing opcode sets  
- Deterministic dataset generator suite  
- Benchmarking + reproducibility tools  
- Additional deterministic APIs (CNF structure analysis, SAT hardness metrics)

## 📜 License Philosophy
STTF is open-source to support academic adoption and transparency.  
Our deterministic generation and analysis pipelines remain proprietary  
and are offered through API-based licensing.
